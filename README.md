# Pharao and Graverobber - A new Role Duo for TTT2

## Pharao (Team Innocent)

- spawns in 50% of the rounds when at least 6 players are spawned
- has an „Ankh“ that can be placed anywhere on the ground
- if the graverobber stole his ankh, he can steal it back but the graverobber gets notified in the same way as he was previously

## Graverobber (Team Traitor)

- as soon as a ankh is placed, one traitor gets converted to a graverobber
- can steal an ankh to make it his own

## The Ankh

- there is a mystical drawing around the ankh
- close range to the ankh the current owner gets slow health regen if the Ankh health is over 40
- the ankh gets automatically healed when the owner is nearby, the healing effect is really fast as long as the ankh HP os below 40
- the ankh lights up if the owner is in close range
- the light starts to flicker if the HP of the ankh is lower than 40
- Once the owner of the ankh dies, he respawns at his ankh with half of his HP after a 10 second cooldown, smoke is spawned and the ankh is removed
- the ankh can be stolen by holding „USE“ while looking at it
- the owner has a wallhack for the ankh to always see its position
- the owner hears a sound and gets a notification if his counterplayer tries to steal his ankh
- a map wide sound is played when the ankh was stolen
- the ankh can be damaged and destroyed by every player
- the ankhowner also sees a status icon displaying if he has an ankh
- stealing the ankh leaves fingerprints on it
- ankh is not placeable when no Ts are alive
- ankh can not be picked up by graverobbers
- if the owner changes its team, he can still take benefit from the ankh, but can't pick it up anymore etc
